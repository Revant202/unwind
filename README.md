# Unwind

## Description

Welcome to Unwind, where music brings people together like never before. Unwind was created by Revant Emany using React, socket.io, Node, Express, and MongoDB.

**My Vision
Unwind envisions a world where music transcends boundaries and brings people together. I believe that sharing music with friends should be seamless, enjoyable, and as immersive as it can get. With this vision in mind, I've crafted a platform that transforms your ordinary listening sessions into extraordinary shared experiences.

**How does Unwind Work?
Unwind is your gateway to synchronized music listening with friends. Here's how it all comes together:
Sign in with Spotify: Connect your Spotify account for instant access to your playlists.
Create or Join a Room: Host your own room or join with a unique code or playlist-based room.
Invite Your Friends: Easily share room codes and connect with friends and music enthusiasts.
Sync Your Tracks: Start playing on Spotify, and Unwind syncs the track for everyone.
Collaborative Queue: Build a dynamic shared playlist with friends
Real-Time Control: Play, pause, or skip tracks collectively, no matter the distance.
